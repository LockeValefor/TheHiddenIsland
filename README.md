# The Hidden Island

## What's this?
- This is a WIP mod that will add a pair of twins (Winnie and Solary) to Stardew Valley.
- For Stardew Valley 1.6+ only.
- This mod is still on a very early stage. Currently there are no events yet.
- Winnie exists. She have a very basic schedule, can be talked to and can receive gifts.
- Solary will be added later. However, he's locked behind Winnie's events.
- This mod might break you game since I'm not very experienced in C# yet. Do back up your save file frequently to be safe.

## How can I meet them?
- After receiving a sword and successfully receive forest magic, you'll receive a mysterious letter. Read the letter to know how to meet them.

## What to be expected in the future?
- Working NPCs with a storyline full of events and choices.
- (Hopefully) A lot of fun experiences.

## Bug report
- Feel free to report bugs to me!

## Known issues/bugs
- This specific type of surprise boxes are overpower/worthless: As long as alpha testers give me feedback/suggestions, I'll try to balance it.
