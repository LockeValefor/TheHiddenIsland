# The Hidden Island

## What's this?
- This is a WIP mod that will add a pair of twins (Winnie and Solary) to Stardew Valley.
- For Stardew Valley 1.6+ only.
- This mod is still on a very early stage. Currently there are no events yet.
- Winnie exists. She have a very basic schedule, can be talked to and can receive gifts.
- Solary will be added later. However, he's locked behind Winnie's events.
- This mod might break you game since I'm not very experienced in C# yet. Do back up your save file frequently to be safe.

## How can I meet them?
- Story purpose: After receiving a sword and successfully receive forest magic, you'll receive a mysterious letter. Read the letter to know how to meet them.
- Test purpose: Use CJB Item Spawner and search for Hidden Island. Use that item to teleport to the island.

## What to be expected in the future?
- Working NPCs with a storyline full of events and choices.
- (Hopefully) A lot of fun experiences.

## Bug report
- Feel free to report bugs to me!

## Known issues/bugs
- This specific type of surprise boxes are overpower/worthless: As long as alpha testers give me feedback/suggestions, I'll try to balance it.

    - Very low body temperature, her skin is as cold as ice. Hates the heat and very comfortable with the cold.
    - Magic does not affect her in any kind. It nullifies itself when having physical contact with her. If a mage make a contact with her physically, their mana will become unstable and if they use their magic with this state, it will be very risky. They will be back to normal when they stay away from her. Same for magic objects - the mana will be unstable and that magic object will not functional until she stop touching it. She cannot use magic or any magic items like potions, totems or teleport circle. Mages cannot use magic to harm her. Monsters with magical core can't harm her with their magic fireballs, acid slimes,... However, she's not immune to physical.
